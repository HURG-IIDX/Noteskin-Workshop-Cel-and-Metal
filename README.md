(Scroll down to the bottom for Customization Instructions!)

Welcome to the noteskin workshgop for Cel and Metal! This is a fully customizable "build your own" noteskin suite based on the default ITG noteskins "Cel" and "Metal". Just about every aspect of the noteskin can be customized. All customization options have preview images that can be browsed in the "previews" folder. Please note that preview images are almost entirely presented at a lower resolution and /or are compressed to reduce file size.

This noteskin was made primarily for ITGMania, but it should work with other versions of modern Stepmania.

For this noteskin to look its best, please set your texture resolution to the highest setting (2048). Some textures use this resolution and will look degraded on lower settings.

Customization options:

-----------------------------------Arrows-----------------------------------

There are a lot of arrow customization options (over 150!) including color sets for ITG, DDR note, DDR Vivid, RGB, and other color schemes seen on other various noteskins, most of which have several variationss for each color scheme. Every variation has a Cel and Metal version. By default the skins use the "ITG" arrow set. In the "previews" folder there are animated previews of every arrow option. There is also a "Color Swatches" folder in the previews folder which gives you a quickly browsable version pf each color scheme.

This noteskin also supports lifts. There is a "Chrome" and "Spectrum" version of both Cel and Metal, these colors should be visually distinct for whataver arrow customization you use. By default, they come with the spectrum versions.
Here is a preview of the lift animations:

-----------------------------------Explosions-----------------------------------

Tap explosions can be customized to different match different judgement color sets. By default it comes with the "ITG" Spark color set, but there are options for things like Rainbowmatic and Waterfall and a few others. There is also an "all white" option if you prefer your tap explosions to be color neutral. Tap explosions come in 3 variants per color set: Spark (X shaped like a DDR tap explosion), Glow (similar to the default ITG Cel/Metal noteskin tap explosions) and Minimal (similar to glow but with a smaller area). There are Cel and MEtal versions of every set. By default the skins come with the ITG Glow tap explosions. You can also disable tap explosions entirely with the "no explosions" customization option.
Here is a preview of some of the tap explosion options:

Hold explosions can be color customized to many different color options and also come in the same 3 variations as tap explosions (Spark, Glow, and Minimal). There are Cel and Metal versions of every option. By default the skin uses the "Default" minimal color option. You can also disable hold explosions entirely with the "no explosions" customization option.

-----------------------------------Holds and Rolls-----------------------------------

Holds and rolls (active and inactive) can be color customized. Every color option has a standard and shadow version. Feel free to mix and match different options! By default the noteskin uses the "default" color options for both holds and rolls.

Customization Instructions:

First extract the "Cel - Workshop" and/or the "Metal - Workshop" folder and place it in your Stepmania install in your noteskins>dance folder. This is the noteskin you will be using as a base for customization. Feel free to rename it as this will be something you can make your own!

It is highly recommended you check the "previews" folder and check to see what color options you want, they are in an easily browsable and viewable format. For arrows specifically, I also recommend checking out the "Color Swatches" folder to determine the arrow color scheme you prefer before picking which variation you want.

In the "Customizations" folder you will find the files/assets needed to change different aspects of the noteskin. Each aspect has numerous color options. Within each color folder you will find the .PNG files needed to change the color of the noteskin aspect. Place those in your Cel or Metal workshop (or whatever you renamed it to if you did) folder and replace the existing .PNG files.

NOTE: For arrow customizations, if you are using any of the "RGB" or DDR Vivid" Variations, it is recommended you open the metrics.ini and change the TapNoteAnimationLength=2 to TapNoteAnimationLength=4. The colors may appear to cycle too quickly if left at 2, but you can leave it at 2 if you prefer.

For example, if you wanted purple Cel holds, you would go to the Customizations>Holds>Cel>Purple folder, and drag those .PNG files into the workshop noteskin's folder.

Please note that the customization files for this slightly differ in filename from the Cel and Metal noteskin includeed with ITGMania, so please use the one included in this download for your color customization needs.
