(Scroll down to the bottom for Customization Instructions!)

Welcome to the noteskin workshgop for Cel and Metal! This is a fully customizable "build your own" noteskin suite based on the default ITG noteskins "Cel" and "Metal". Just about every aspect of the noteskin can be customized. All customization options have preview images that can be browsed in the "previews" folder. Please note that preview images are almost entirely presented at a lower resolution and /or are compressed to reduce file size.

Customization options:

-----------------------------------Arrows-----------------------------------

There are a lot of arrow customization options (over 150!) including color sets for ITG, DDR note, DDR Vivid, RGB, and other color schemes seen on other various noteskins, most of which have several variationss for each color scheme. Every variation has a Cel and Metal version. By default the skins use the "ITG" arrow set. In the "previews" folder there are animated previews of every arrow option. There is also a "Color Swatches" folder in the previews folder which gives you a quickly browsable version pf each color scheme.

This noteskin also supports lifts. There is a "Chrome" and "Spectrum" version of both Cel and Metal, these colors should be visually distinct for whataver arrow customization you use.
Here is a preview of the lift animations:

-----------------------------------Explosions-----------------------------------

Tap explosions can be customized to different match different judgement color sets. By default it comes with the "ITG" Spark color set, but there are options for things like Rainbowmatic and Waterfall and a few others. There is also an "all white" option if you prefer your tap explosions to be color neutral. Tap explosions come in 3 variants per color set: Spark (X shaped like a DDR tap explosion), Glow (similar to the default ITG Cel/Metal noteskin tap explosions) and Minimal (similar to glow but with a smaller area). There are Cel and MEtal versions of every set. By default the skins come with the ITG Glow tap explosions. You can also disable tap explosions entirely with the "no explosions" customization option.

Hold explosions can be color customized to many different color options and also come in the same 3 variations as tap explosions (Spark, Glow, and Minimal). There are Cel and Metal versions of every option. By default the skin uses the "Default" minimal color option. You can also disable hold explosions entirely with the "no explosions" customization option.
